# RTTMAS Android Client

This is the Android client-side application for the Realtime Traffic Monitoring and Analysis System (RTTMAS) project.

The app is made for drivers to receive real-time traffic warnings to enhance road safety. The RTTMAS server continously monitor the road situation and sends alerts to nearby drivers.

As a return, the app would periodically capture the road situation in front and report back to the server for analysis.

Users are expected to install and run this app on their Android device(s) while driving. The device would be mounted on the dash facing forward.
